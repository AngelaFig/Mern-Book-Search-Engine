# <MERN:Book-Search-Engine>

## Description

In this project, I have taken a fully functional Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API and refactored it to a functional GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with REACT front end,MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.
The application allows a user to search for new books to read as well as keep a list of saved books that they would like to purchase.
